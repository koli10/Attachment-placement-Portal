Attachment Placement Portal

Problem Background
Industrial attachment is an academic requirement to most undergraduate courses that students must accomplish during their second, third or fifth years of study depending on the faculty. It aims at impacting valuable practical experiences to prepare the students for the workforce upon graduation. The students get to apply classroom knowledge to real-world situations.
Seeking attachment opportunities is difficult and strenuous to find since it involves moving from one office to another. Students are faced with the challenge of change in environment from the school one to the job market under a limited amount of time. The students who get attachment opportunities are also placed under irrelevant departments that does not relate with their area of study.

Aim of the study
The aim of this project is to come up with a web portal for students to apply for attachment opportunities with a click of the button. Web portal would also be used by companies to advertise their available attachment and internship opportunities together with their terms and conditions such as working hours, payment and duties of the attach√© or the intern. The system will be able to place the students in relevant departments and organizations related to their field of study.
